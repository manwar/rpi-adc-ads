    RPi::ADS1x15 - Interface to ADS1x15 series analog to digital converters
    (ADC) on Raspberry Pi

SYNOPSIS
      use RPi::ADS1x15 qw(fetch);

      my $adc_addr = 0x48;
      my $i2c_dev  = "/dev/i2c-1";

      my $volts = fetch($adc_addr, $i2c_dev)

DESCRIPTION
    Perl interface to the Adafruit ADS 1x15 series Analog to Digital
    Converters (ADC) on the Raspberry Pi.

    In this first release, only channel 0 on the ADC is available. Next
    version will provide provisions to access them all.
