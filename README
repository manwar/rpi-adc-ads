NAME
    RPi::ADS1x15 - Interface to ADS1x15 series analog to digital converters
    (ADC) on Raspberry Pi

SYNOPSIS
      use RPi::ADS1x15 qw(fetch);

      my $adc_addr = 0x48;
      my $i2c_dev  = "/dev/i2c-1";

      my $volts = fetch($adc_addr, $i2c_dev)

DESCRIPTION
    Perl interface to the Adafruit ADS 1x15 series Analog to Digital
    Converters (ADC) on the Raspberry Pi.

    In this first release, only channel 0 on the ADC is available. Next
    version will provide provisions to access them all.

PHYSICAL SETUP
    List of pinouts between the ADC and the Raspberry Pi.

        ADC     Pi
        -----------
        VDD     Vcc
        GND     Gnd
        SCL     SCL (NOT SCLK)
        SDA     SDA
        ADDR    Gnd
        ALRT    NC  (no connect)

    Pinouts `A0' through `A3' on the ADC are the analog pins used to connect
    to external peripherals.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

  EXPORT_OK
    Exports `fetch()' on demand.

FUNCTIONS
  fetch
    Returns a float that represents the analog voltage level.

    Parameters:

    $adc_addr
    Mandatory. The hex location of the ADC. If the pinout in PHYSICAL SETUP
    is used, this will be `0x48'.

    $i2c_dev
    Mandatory. The filesystem path to the i2c device file. Typically
    `/dev/i2c-1'.
